# Writeups of <https://pwnable.kr> Toddler's Bottle levels

At some point, I hope to edit these for clarity/cleanliness and also, so that they can serve as hits without outright giving the answer for any particular level. In some of the introductory levels, I write things out very explicitly with some extra links such that they could serve as a learning resource to a beginner. Perhaps at some point, I'll split out prereq knowledge into its own writeup, along with all the external links I put in.

Note that at the current time, I only intend to post solutions for challenges from Toddler's Bottle because of Rule 3

> challenges in Toddler's Bottle are allowed to freely post the solutions online. However, please refrain from posting solution for challenges in other categories. But if you insist, post easy ones (solved by many people) and do not spoil too much details for the sake of fun.
