Hello, I'm Daniel Rebelsky. I studied computer science and music at Stanford, where I got my MS and BS in CS (undergrad minor in music). You can find more of my online presence on

* <https://soundcloud.com/stanfordjazzorchestra> (I played baritone saxophone in the Stanford Jazz Orchestra from fall of 2019 through spring of 2023, so any recordings from that time period probably include me).
* My [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danielrebelsky5075/videos), which includes both the animated short films I made for the Iowa High School Speech Association (IHSSA) competitions and my performances of hitting a drum 10,000 times (for which I used to be the first to pop up when Googling "Hitting a drum 10,000 times (left hand)")
