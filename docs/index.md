Hello, I'm Daniel Rebelsky, a fifth-year coterminal student at Stanford University studying computer science and music. You can find more of my online presence on

* [GitHub](https://github.com/drebelsky)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rebelsky/)
* my [Music 220A Portfolio](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rebelsky/220a/)

You can see watch/hear some more of my performances at
* [SLOrktastic Chamber Music 2023](https://slork.stanford.edu/events/2023/slorktastic/)
* [2023: A SLOrker's Guide to Computer Music](https://slork.stanford.edu/events/2023/spring/)
* <https://soundcloud.com/stanfordjazzorchestra> (I played baritone saxophone in the Stanford Jazz Orchestra from fall of 2019 through spring of 2023, so any other recordings from that time period probably also include me).
* My [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danielrebelsky5075/videos), which includes both the animated short films I made for the Iowa High School Speech Association (IHSSA) competitions and my performances of hitting a drum 10,000 times (of which I'm the first to pop up when you google "Hitting a drum 10,000 times (left hand)")
